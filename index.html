    <h2>Introduction</h2>
	  <p class="demopara"> This is blog is meant to be a starting point for any new Swift user. It is meant to be an informative blog that contains a history of the programming language, as well as look at some acutal code. As new users of Swift ourselves, this is blog is here to help guide us in our learning of Swift, and inform you on certain findings that we may find interesting. Thank you.</p>
    <p class="demopara">"Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS. 
	Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, 
	and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design, yet also 
	produces software that runs lightning-fast." - Apple</p>
      
	  
	<h2>Using Xcode:</h2>
	  <p class="demopara"> Xcode is an Integrated Development Environment developed for Mac and iOS developers. It allows its users to write and compile code 
		  in one application. "Swift compiles software more quickly, helps you deliver faster apps, and generates even smaller binaries. 
		  Test suites complete many times faster, working with a team is simpler and more secure, and much more." </p>
      
	  
	  <h2>Example Code:</h2>
    <p class="demopara"> Declaring a function in swift:</p>	  
	  <center><img src="hello2.jpg"></center>
	  
	  <h2>Modern Features of Swift:</h2>
	  <li>Implemnetation of Strings and Substrings becomes much easier and faster</li>
	  <li>Smart key paths for type-safe, efficient, extensible key value coding for Swift types</li>
	  <li>Enhancements to creating and manipulating Dictionary and Set types</li>
	  <li>Extends support of archival and serialization to struct and enum types and enables type-safety for serializing to external formats such as JSON and plist</li>
	  <li>Enforced exclusive access to memory</li> 
	  
	  <h2>A Brief History of Swift:</h2>
	  <p>Swift programming language was first introduced at Apple’s 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference.</p>

<p class="demopara"><center><i>“Initially, it was really just me messing around and nobody knew about it because it wasn’t anything to know about. But eventually, it got a little bit more serious […] So I started talking to my management and some of the engineers that were working on Clang, and they seemed excited about it. We got a couple people working on it part-time and I convinced my manager that it was interesting enough that we could have a couple of people work on it.”
	– Chris Lattner, January, 2017</i></center></p>
<p class="demopara">The initial reactions and reviews of swift were not great, but not terrible (2015ish). A lot of developers enjoyed certain aspects of Swift’s simplicity and flexibility. After some fine tuning, it was finally time for Swift 4.0 release. This was a significant release for Swift, as the popularity grew exponentially. “One of the reasons that Swift has become so popular over such a short period is probably the fact that it was made by Apple. When a company with such global name recognition and a multimillion army of loyal followers does something, the chances are it is doomed for success (or at least good press coverage).” </p>

	  <h2>Recursion in Swift:</h2>
	  <p class="demopara">A function that calls itself is a simple but extremely useful technique called <u>recursion</u>. Recursion can implemented in every programming language, and is not too different in Swift. 
		  Recursion is a very powerful tool if it can be applied correctly and efficiently. Recursion also helps with condensing code. </p>

	  <h2>Lets take a look at the Pros and Cons of Swift</h2>
	  
	  <h1>Pros:</h1>
	  <li><u>Rapid Development Process</u></li>

<p class="demopara">Swift is known for being a clean and expressive language with simple syntax. It also requires less code to perform certain tasks when compared to C programming. It uses ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) to track the app’s usage and memory. This was a major plus for Swift, as it gave developers more time to spend on other details. 

One example of this is the Lyft (car riding) app. They decided to re-write their entire app using Swift, and ended up writing it in less than one third of the lines. </p>


	  <li><u>Easy to scale the product</u></li> 
<p class="demopara">In addition to faster development time, you get a product that is future-proof and can be extended with new features as needed. Thus, Swift projects are typically easier to scale. The fact that Apple is more likely to support Swift than Objective-C should also get serious consideration for long-term investment.</p> 

	  <li><u>Better safety and performance</u></li>
<p class="demopara">“Swift focuses on performance and speed, the language was initially designed to outperform its predecessor. Namely, the initial release claimed a 40 percent increase in performance, as compared to Objective-C.”<p> 

	  <li><u>Decreased memory footprint</u></li>
<p class="demopara">“When you build an app, you use a lot of third-party code – reusable and often open source frameworks or libraries compiled into your app’s code. These libraries can be static and dynamic (or shared). Swift first introduced dynamic libraries to iOS when it launched. You can probably guess that static libraries are locked into code at the time you compiled them, become the part of your executable file, thus increasing its size and load time. They also can’t be automatically updated since they’re stuck in the version you compiled at. Dynamic libraries, on the other hand, exist outside of your code and are uploaded only when needed. Static libraries need to have copies in all files of your program while dynamic ones only need one.”</p> 

	  <li>Interoperability with Objective-C</li>
<li>Automatic memory management</li>
<li>Full stack potential and cross-device support</li>
<li>Vibrant open source community and learnability</li>

	  <li>clones of apps like YouTube or like Firefox</li>
