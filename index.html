	  <h2>Introduction</h2>
	  <p class="demopara"> This is blog is meant to be a starting point for any new Swift user. It is meant to be an informative blog that contains a history of the programming language, as well as look at some acutal code. As new users of Swift ourselves, this is blog is here to help guide us in our learning of Swift, and inform you on certain findings that we may find interesting. Thank you.</p>
    <p class="demopara">"Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS. 
	Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, 
	and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design, yet also 
	produces software that runs lightning-fast." - Apple</p>
      <hr/>
	  
	<h2>What is Xcode?:</h2>
	  <p class="demopara"> Xcode is an Integrated Development Environment developed for Mac and iOS developers. It allows its users to write and compile code 
		  in one application. "Swift compiles software more quickly, helps you deliver faster apps, and generates even smaller binaries. 
		  Test suites complete many times faster, working with a team is simpler and more secure, and much more." </p>

	   <hr/>
	  <h2>Modern Features of Swift:</h2>
	  <li>Implemnetation of Strings and Substrings becomes much easier and faster</li>
	  <li>Smart key paths for type-safe, efficient, extensible key value coding for Swift types</li>
	  <li>Enhancements to creating and manipulating Dictionary and Set types</li>
	  <li>Extends support of archival and serialization to struct and enum types and enables type-safety for serializing to external formats such as JSON and plist</li>
	  <li>Enforced exclusive access to memory</li>

	  <h2>A Brief History of Swift:</h2>
	  <p>Swift programming language was first introduced at Apple’s 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference.</p>

<p class="demopara"><center><i>“Initially, it was really just me messing around and nobody knew about it because it wasn’t anything to know about. But eventually, it got a little bit more serious […] So I started talking to my management and some of the engineers that were working on Clang, and they seemed excited about it. We got a couple people working on it part-time and I convinced my manager that it was interesting enough that we could have a couple of people work on it.”
	– Chris Lattner, January, 2017</i></center></p>
<p class="demopara">The initial reactions and reviews of swift were not great, but not terrible (2015ish). A lot of developers enjoyed certain aspects of Swift’s simplicity and flexibility. After some fine tuning, it was finally time for Swift 4.0 release. This was a significant release for Swift, as the popularity grew exponentially. “One of the reasons that Swift has become so popular over such a short period is probably the fact that it was made by Apple. When a company with such global name recognition and a multimillion army of loyal followers does something, the chances are it is doomed for success (or at least good press coverage).” </p>

	  <h2>Recursion in Swift:</h2>
	  <p class="demopara">A function that calls itself is a simple but extremely useful technique called <u>recursion</u>. Recursion can implemented in every programming language, and is not too different in Swift. 
		  Recursion is a very powerful tool if it can be applied correctly and efficiently. Recursion also helps with condensing code. </p>

	  <h2>Lets take a look at the Pros and Cons of Swift</h2>
	  <h1>PROS:</h1>
	  <li><u>Rapid Development Process</u></li>

<p class="demopara">Swift is known for being a clean and expressive language with simple syntax. It also requires less code to perform certain tasks when compared to C programming. It uses ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) to track the app’s usage and memory. This was a major plus for Swift, as it gave developers more time to spend on other details. 

One example of this is the Lyft (car riding) app. They decided to re-write their entire app using Swift, and ended up writing it in less than one third of the lines. </p>


	  <li><u>Easy to scale the product</u></li> 
<p class="demopara">In addition to faster development time, you get a product that is future-proof and can be extended with new features as needed. Thus, Swift projects are typically easier to scale. The fact that Apple is more likely to support Swift than Objective-C should also get serious consideration for long-term investment.</p> 

	  <li><u>Better safety and performance</u></li>
<p class="demopara">One of the main focuses of Swift programming language is its speed and performance. Since Swift was designed and created so recently, they were able to incorporate some pretty neat details. Swift’s initial release claimed a performance increase of 40% when compared to Objective-C.<p> 

	  <li><u>Decreased memory footprint</u></li>
<p class="demopara">Swift’s ability to use dynamic libraries greatly decreased its memory footprint. When developing, using other open source libraries happens a lot. Now, these libraries can either be static or dynamic (shared). Swift incorporated these dynamic libraries, which helped increase size and load time. “Static libraries are locked into code at the time you compiled them, become the part of your executable file, thus increasing its size and load time. They also can’t be automatically updated since they’re stuck in the version you compiled at. Dynamic libraries, on the other hand, exist outside of your code and are uploaded only when needed. Static libraries need to have copies in all files of your program while dynamic ones only need one.”
</p> 

	  <li><u>Automatic memory management</u></li>
	  <p class="demopara">Swift’s interesting and automatic memory management system is very well down. Using Automatic Memory Counting (ARC), Swift is able to add a garbage collector function that was actually not introduced to iOS. Most programming languages use the garbage collectors to delete class instances that aren’t needed. While this is very useful for decreasing the memory footprint, it adds load on to the CPU. Before ARC was introduced developers had to constantly and manually manage their classes. Which, as a developer, is something that can become quite tedious at points, but nevertheless, is an extremely important skill to know. ARC is a great feature of Swift, and is something that the developers can truly appreciate. It allows developers to increase theirs apps performance without causing lag to the memory or CPU.</p>


	  <li><u>Vibrant open source community and learnability</u></li> 
	  <p class="demopara">Apple’s Senior VP of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi, mentioned, “We saw open sourcing as a critical element to make Swift reach its potential to be the language, the major language for the next 20 years of programming in our industry.”
Swift, being such a young language, has major potential. One strong aspect on its side, is the its open source community and learnability. With help from Apple and even IBM, Swift has quickly gained a vast and vibrant open source community. Swift’s potential is endless, but things to be executed in an efficient and strategic manner.</p> 

 <hr/>
	  
	  <h1>CONS:</h1>
	  
	  <li><u>Young Language</u></li>
	  <p class="demopara">Now, this can be looked at as Pro if only looking at the potential of the language. For this very moment, a young language typically means lots of bugs and fixes. Languages needs decades of fine tuning, and will still never be 100% perfect. Swift needs to mature before it can recognized as top programming language. We will just have to wait and see. Also, Swift has a limited number of libraries and tools (as many are still being developed). There are many resources and tools dedicated to versions of Swift that are useless until newer releases. Overall, yes, Swift is an extremely young language with many fixes and releases to come, but the potential still remains enormous.</p>

	  <li><u>Backwards Compatibility Issues</u></li>
	  <p class="demopara"> One huge issue that many developers have expressed are issues with backwards compatibility with newer versions of the language. This forced developer’s to have to complete rewrite their Swift programs when a new version became available. Xcode is a great tool that every developer’s using Mac book should have. Now, it was supposed to help developers update their Swift code to a newer version, but didn’t really fix all the issues</p>
	  
	  <li><u>Limited Talent Pool</u></li>
	  <p class="demopara">Yes, Swift is a great new and upcoming programming language, but it just doesn’t compare to other open source languages. Apple does express that people are demanding more from Swift, and people are trying to put as much effort at possible into learning it, but can be problematic, which leads to developers giving up on learning the language. </p>
	     
	    <li><u>Poor interoperability with third-party tools and IDEs</u></li>
	  <p class="demopara">This is one of major complaints I have come across when researching problems that developers have had with Swift. Using tools is Swift is a major problem, and are causing major problems for developers. Xcode, Apple’s IDE, and what they recommend to write and compile if using Swift, lags in tool support for Swift. This is a huge problem that needs to be fixed or they will lose all their develooprs.</p>

	   <h2>Personal notes on Swift Programming Language so far:</h2>
	  <p class="demopara">After doing some very basic research on Swift, it seems that there is a lot of potential for this programming language. It definitely helps that Apple was the company to release Swift because it allowed the language to have a customer base already. It is interesting doing research on such a new language because there are some many new things that can be added in today’s world. Obviously, this is just the beginning of the Swift programming language, and it will be interesting to see how popular it is 10 years from now. 
One thing that I have come across that is great about Swift is its compatibility with Apple products (laptops). Obviously, Swift was made by Apple, so it should be relatively easy to use with their laptops. Now, I am not saying that it is complicated running other programming languages on Apple laptops, but sometimes can prove to be bigger of an issue then it needs to be. The easiness and flawlessness of running and compiling Swift code on Apple laptops is a really nice feature for me, but obviously might not be as big of deal to other people.
Another aspect of Swift that I enjoyed reading about was how to create an App with Swift. Swift has made it extremely easy to write/code a quick App. <p>

	  <h2>Lets take a look at some Sorting Algorithms in Swift:</h2>

<p class="demopara">Sorting algorithms Swift are fairly straightforward and are quite similar to many other popular programming languages. Lets take a look at a couple of the more popular sorting algorithms, and how they are implemented in Swift.</p>

<h1><u>Bubble Sort:</u></h1>
<p class="demopara">This algorithm nowadays has just an educational meaning because it’s always slow (with always I mean it’s slow in the best or worst case), it’s O(n²) in time complexity. This means that it needs always n² steps to converge to the solution (i.e. input N = 50, number of steps to reach the solution = 1000). This is an in-place algorithm because it doesn’t need any external storage to perform the sorting.</p>

<p class="demopara">You don’t have to pass the array to sort to the method but you can do something like (using the function bubbleSort() defined below):</p>
